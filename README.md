# Wych-Debater
AI Debater is aimed to be first AI system that can debate humans on complex topics.
It’s able to debate topics it never trained on.
With just a few minutes of prep, AI Debater is ready to deliver an opening speech.
First, it searches for short pieces of text, drawing from around billions of sentences taken from newspapers and journals.
This process can result in a few hundred relevant text segments.
The AI system removes redundant text,
Selects the strongest remaining claims and evidence, and arranges these by themes to create a narrative.
AI debater pieces all the selected arguments together to create and deliver a persuasive speech.
The next step is to listen to the opponent’s response, digest it and build a rebuttal.
The core technology breaks new ground in AI including
Data-driven speech writing and delivery
Listening comprehension
Modelling human dilemmas.

Building an AI system which can debate humans on complex topics. AI learns the art of debate.
The goal is to help people build persuasive arguments and make well-informed decisions.
The rise of one-sided and doctored narratives is challenging society, Too often, we talk past one 
another. We need a smarter way. 
New developments in language and reasoning in AI can help shine a light in the darkness of distorted 
facts to provide diverse, well-informed viewpoints—both the pro and the con.
The world is awash with information, misinformation, and superficial thinking. AI Debater pushes the 
frontiers of AI to facilitate intelligent debate so we can build well-informed arguments and make better 
decisions.

“Can this ancient art bring us new perspectives.”

 To build an AI system that is capable of engaging with human in a live debate. It’s able to debate topics it 
never trained on.
Our Aim is to create AI that can master the infinitely complex and rich world of human language.
Language can tell us more about human thoughts and emotions. We believe there is great potential in
having artificial intelligence that can understand us. Such that we can trust more on this and so we can
rely on this to help us to solve problems.
The ultimate goal of this AI debater is to help us all make better and more informed decision

Introduction (What is AI Debater?)
AI Debater is the first AI system that can debate humans on complex topics. AI 
Debater digests massive texts, constructs a well-structured speech on a given 
topic, delivers it with clarity and purpose, and rebuts its opponent. Eventually, 
AI Debater will help people reason by providing compelling, evidence-based 
arguments and limiting the influence of emotion, bias, or ambiguity.

How does the Debater system know if a claim is for or against the topic it's given?

★★★★★ Future Scope

The interaction of man and machine could be enriching for both. It’s not a question of one being better than the other, but about AI and humans working together.
Master the complex and rich world of human language.
Fake news detection
In Judiciary it can be used to fasten the case hearing process.
Academics for learning purpose with knowing both pro and cons
Policy making, AI debater will enrich the end user with facts and narratives.

How does AI Debater work?

AI Debater relies on three pioneering capabilities. The first is data-driven speech writing and delivery,
or the ability to automatically generate a whole speech, reminiscent of an opinion article, and deliver it
persuasively. The second is listening comprehension, which is the ability to understand a long
spontaneous speech made by the human opponent in order to construct a meaningful rebuttal. The third
is the system’s ability to model human dilemmas and form principled arguments made by humans in
different debates based on a unique knowledge graph. By combining these core capabilities, it can
conduct a meaningful debate with human debaters.

The basics Steps
Step 1 - Understanding a topic 
Step 2 - Argument construction
Step 3 - Content Organization
Step 4 - Constructing an argument and rebuttal

● Argument Mining
● Stance Classification and Sentiment Analysis
● Deep Neural Nets (DNNs) and Weak Supervision
● Text-to-Speech (TTS) Systems

☆☆☆☆☆☆☆

★★ Argument Mining

Claims and evidence are the main components of an argument; identifying and using them correctly 
are essential to framing an argument in a debate. Developing machine learning techniques to mine 
massive corpora for claims and evidence and use them to generate arguments relevant to a 
controversial topic.
● Detecting claims in relevant documents
● Detecting evidence in relevant documents 
● Negating claims
● Synthesizing novel claims
● Detecting claims throughout a corpus 
● Improving corpus-wide claim detection 
● Assessing argumentation quality
● Relating arguments across texts

★★Stance Classification and Sentiment Analysis
An automatic debating system must be able to identify whether an argument supports or contests a 
given topic. This is fairly easy for humans but difficult for machines, as it requires great sensitivity to 
the rich subtleties and nuances of natural language. We have made important progress in this 
intriguing line of research.
● Determining expert opinion stance
● Determining claim stance 
● Improving claim stance classification
● Classifying sentiment of phrases
● Classifying sentiment of idioms


★★Deep Neural Nets (DNNs) and Weak Supervision
DNNs hold immense potential for improving automatic understanding of language, but training them is 
notoriously known to require a lot of high quality, manually labeled data. We have to develop tools and 
methods to train DNNs using weak supervision, alleviating that bottleneck & also use DNNs in 
developing AI Debater’s speaking and listening skills.
● Scoring arguments
● Understanding Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
 output
● Predicting phrase breaks
● Emphasizing words and phrases
● Improving speech patterns 
● Identifying similar sentences 
● Improving argument mining
● Searching for claims throughout a corpus
● Determining concept abstractness

★★ Text-to-Speech (TTS) Systems
Unlike a personal assistant or navigator, a debating system needs to speak continuously and 
persuasively for a few minutes on a subject not known in advance, while keeping the audience 
engaged. We developed new TTS algorithms and techniques to give AI Debater a clear, fluent, and 
persuasive voice.
● Predicting phrase breaks
● Emphasizing words and phrases 
● Improving speech patterns
